Suicide Rate - By Country - WHO (4 Breakout by Year) 
 
http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDEASDR?lang=en 
 
 
Can we statistically confirm and identify which measures/indicators are best associated with suicide rate?  
 
Proposed metadata:   
 
 
GDP per capita ->https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?view=map 
Education Index -> https://data.oecd.org/eduatt/adult-education-level.htm 
Female labor force participation rate -> http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/labour-force-participation-rate-female-male-ratio 
 
 
I am definitely open to more/different factors as well.

(b)  Project description 

Suicide Rate: Country Specific Health Agencies: 

1. Overall mortality - birth, cancer - all going down
2. Suicide rates - compared to other increasing
	Where and why

Interested socioeconomic factors (more as control?) influence suicide....

Other leading indicators: 

 
(c)  How and where you obtained the data  
WHO

(d)  Scientific Research questions you may want to address 

Research objectives

1) Identification of indicators of suicide rate

- Research question 1
- Research question 2

2) High level decision making support for leaders and public policy leaders

- Research question 1
- Research question 2

3) Making these topics more accessible to other researchers in the field

- Research question 1
- Research question 2


Potential Research Questions: 

Do factors such as development of a country (GDP per capita, Adult education level) affect ABR? 
Do factors such as M/F ratio at different stages of life (Ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary, and tertiary education) affect ABR? 
Do health care factors affect ABR (Nurses and midwives (per 1000 population), Country's Current health expenditure (% of GDP) per year)? 
Does migration to a country affect ABR? 
Which factors seem statistically insignificant for association with ABR? 
Do certain factors play a larger role depending on the region? 
 
(e)  The proposed statistical methods and models (this can be changed later).
