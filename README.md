Adolescent birth rate: the annual number of births to women 15 to 19 years of age per 1,000 women in that age group 
Adolescent birth rate data -> http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.1630AG?lang=en 
 
http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MHSUICIDEASDR?lang=en 
 
 
Can we statistically confirm and identify which measures/indicators are best associated with adolescent birth rates?  
UN info about the adolescent birth rate: 
http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mi/wiki/5-4-Adolescent-birth-rate.ashx 
 
Proposed factors:  
 
 
GDP per capita ->https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?view=map 
Education Index -> https://data.oecd.org/eduatt/adult-education-level.htm 
Female labor force participation rate -> http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/labour-force-participation-rate-female-male-ratio 
 
 
I am definitely open to more/different factors as well.   
 
(a)  Your name(s) 
Samuel Garcia, Michael Szostak, Osman Ghandour 
(b)  Project description 
Adolescent birth rate (ABR) is the annual number of births to women 15 to 19 years of age per 1,000 women in that age group. Adolescent birth rate is a progress indicator for Millennium Development Goal target 5, which is to improve maternal health. It is generally accepted that socioeconomic factors influence adolescent birth rates.... 
 
(c)  How and where you obtained the data  
(see excel) 
(d)  Scientific Research questions you may want to address 
Do factors such as development of a country (GDP per capita, Adult education level) affect ABR? 
Do factors such as M/F ratio at different stages of life (Ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary, and tertiary education) affect ABR? 
Do health care factors affect ABR (Nurses and midwives (per 1000 population), Country's Current health expenditure (% of GDP) per year)? 
Does migration to a country affect ABR? 
Which factors seem statistically insignificant for association with ABR? 
Do certain factors play a larger role depending on the region? 
 
(e)  The proposed statistical methods and models (this can be changed later). 
Multiple linear regression, anova??, weighted least squares multiple linear regression,
